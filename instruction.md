* **1st slider** 
    + Choose the number of measurements, i.e. how often Tom stands on the scale to measure his weight.
* **2nd slider** 
    + Choose the size of the systematic measurement error, i.e. the bias that is systematically added to all measurements.
* **3rd slider** 
    + Choose the size of the random error, i.e. the random bias that is added to each measurement.

* **Beware**
    + You need to measure at least once (times = 1) to assess systematic and random error.
    + Whenever you change one of the slider values (for either times, systematic or random error) new data is generated. Hence, it is not possible to add new measurement values to old ones that you already generated. That is why the mean of the measured values jumps around when you change the random error. Actually, each time you change the slider, a set of new measurement values is pulled out of a normal distribution with a specific mean and variance.
